# Cloud Processing Guide for Large EEG Data

## The Problem
- Each EEG file: ~0.33GB
- 100+ subjects = 33GB+ of raw data
- Local storage and processing limitations

## Recommended Solutions (In Order of Ease)

### 1. **Google Colab + Google Drive** ⭐ **BEST FOR RESEARCH**

**Setup:**
1. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Create new notebook
3. Mount Google Drive:
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
4. Install packages:
```python
!pip install mne mne-bids pandas numpy scikit-learn
```
5. Download data directly to Drive:
```python
# Use your existing download script but change output to:
output_dir = "/content/drive/MyDrive/lemon_eeg_data"
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Free GPU access
- ✅ 15GB Google Drive storage
- ✅ No setup required
- ✅ Easy sharing
- ✅ Jupyter notebook interface

**Cost:** Free (or $10/month for Colab Pro)

### 2. **External SSD + Local Processing**

**Setup:**
1. Buy external SSD (1TB = ~$100)
2. Download data to external drive
3. Process in batches of 10-20 subjects
4. Keep raw data on external drive

**Benefits:**
- ✅ One-time cost
- ✅ Fast local processing
- ✅ No internet dependency
- ✅ Full control

**Cost:** ~$100 for 1TB SSD

### 3. **AWS S3 + EC2** (For Production)

**Setup:**
1. Create S3 bucket for storage
2. Upload EEG files to S3
3. Launch EC2 instance with GPU
4. Process data in cloud
5. Download results

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Scalable
- ✅ Professional infrastructure
- ✅ GPU instances available

**Cost:** ~$1-5/hour for GPU instance + S3 storage

## Quick Start Recommendation

**For your research project, I recommend Google Colab:**

1. **Run the setup script:**
```bash
python scripts/colab_setup.py
```

2. **Upload the generated files to Google Drive**

3. **Open Google Colab and run:**
```python
# Mount drive
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Install packages
!pip install mne mne-bids pandas numpy scikit-learn

# Download data to Drive
!python download_to_drive.py

# Process data
!python simple_process.py
```

## Memory Management Tips

1. **Process one subject at a time**
2. **Delete raw data after feature extraction**
3. **Use compressed formats (.npz)**
4. **Downsample early (250 Hz instead of 1000 Hz)**

## Expected Timeline

- **Setup:** 30 minutes
- **Download 100 subjects:** 2-4 hours
- **Processing:** 4-8 hours
- **Total:** 1-2 days

## Next Steps

1. Try Google Colab first (free, easy)
2. If you need more storage, consider external SSD
3. For production deployment, use AWS

The key is to start simple and scale up as needed!
